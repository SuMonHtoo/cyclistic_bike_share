# cyclistic_bike_share_data_analysis
Case Study from Google Data Analytics Specialization course on Coursera

### Objective
To solve a business task which is to convert casual bike riders to members.

### Data Source
Cyclistic's historical trip data wil be used. However, since Cyclistic is a fictional company so I will use the sample dataset which is made available from Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). You can also download the [dataset](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and practise together with me. 

### Introduction
I will perform data analysis in three different ways:
* Using MS Office Excel
* Using mySQL+Tableau
* Using R Programming Language

## Using MS Office Excel
Since there are over 600k+ records in just 202205-divvy-tripdata.csv alone (trip data for May2022), I will focus only on one spreadsheet and limit targeted time range to only one month.
* Data cleaning steps ->
* Data analysis + Data Visualization -> [myCS_202205-divvy-tripdata_30JUN22.xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-j15ZtpW955q8VB2_qnMJmkNB3L9HKKs/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109332247214363806603&rtpof=true&sd=true)
