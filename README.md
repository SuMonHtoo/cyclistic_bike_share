# cyclistic_bike_share_data_analysis
Case Study from Google Data Analytics Specialization course on Coursera

### Objective
To solve a business task which is to convert casual bike riders to members.

### Data Source
Cyclistic's historical trip data wil be used. However, since Cyclistic is a fictional company so I will use the sample dataset which is made available from Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). You can also download the [dataset](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and practise together with me.
